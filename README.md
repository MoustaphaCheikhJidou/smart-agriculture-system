## üõ†Ô∏è Features

1. **Smart Irrigation System**:
   - Monitors soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity using sensors.
   - Automatically activates irrigation systems based on real-time data.

2. **Crop Health Detection**:
   - Utilizes NDVI data from satellite imagery to evaluate crop health.
   - Provides actionable insights for farmers to improve yield.

3. **Pest Infestation Warning**:
   - Allows users to upload plant images for pest detection.
   - Classifies conditions as healthy, rust, scab, or multiple diseases.

4. **User Portal**:
   - Displays real-time weather data and NDVI maps.
   - Visualizes data using **Chart.js** for better decision-making.
